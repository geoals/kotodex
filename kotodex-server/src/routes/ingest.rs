//! `POST /api/lines` — the ledger's front door for captured text.
//!
//! Every source goes through here: the Textractor logger beside a VN, a bridge
//! from another mining tool, a phone reading an epub. A source writing the table
//! itself would have to know the column list, which is how one column comes to be
//! defined differently in two places — and a source on a phone cannot anyway.
//!
//! What the source owns is turning its own capture into a line — the hooker's
//! junk, a continuation split across two text boxes, its own dedup. What the
//! ledger owns is everything derived: the character count, which work the line
//! belongs to, whether capture is paused at all.
