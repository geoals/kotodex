//! Paper books — logging a book read on paper against its epub.
//!
//! The library owns the work; this module owns the epub underneath it. The
//! shelf adds a book (`upload`, `setup`); the book's own page logs sittings
//! against it (`preview`, `log`).
//!
//! Four calls, in the order they are made: **upload** the epub, **setup** to
//! say where the story starts and what pages the paper copy runs between,
//! then **preview** and **log** once per sitting.
//!
//! **skip** is the fifth and is used once, on a book already part-read when
//! its epub is added: it moves the position without writing a session.
//!
//! Preview and log are separate because the anchor search can land in the
//! wrong place — the same ten characters occur twice, or the reader typed a
//! line they had already logged — and the only reliable check is seeing the
//! text around it. Preview returns that context and the offset it found; log
//! takes the offset back rather than searching again, so what is saved is what
//! was confirmed.
//!
//! A logged sitting is an ordinary `manual_sessions` row carrying the text
//! between the two positions. Nothing downstream knows it came from paper:
//! ingest tokenizes the content into the ledger, `word_days` and the kanji
//! grid on its own watermark, and the character count is `count_chars` like
//! every other.
