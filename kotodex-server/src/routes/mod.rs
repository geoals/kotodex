//! HTTP handlers, one module per resource.
//!
//! Handlers are deliberately thin: parse the query, ask [`crate::history`] or
//! [`crate::db`] for rows, shape the JSON. Anything that decides *what a number
//! means* belongs in [`crate::stats`], where it can be tested without a server.
//!
//! | module | endpoints |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`summary`] | `/api/summary` — today, the goal meter, the streak |
//! | [`days`] | `/api/days` — the daily bar/trend series |
//! | [`timeline`] | `/api/day/timeline` — one day's intra-day curve |
//! | [`sessions`] | `/api/sessions` — derived sittings + manual entries |
//! | [`works`] | `/api/works` — per-VN totals and metadata |
//! | [`books`] | `/api/books/*` — a paper book logged against its epub |
//! | [`lookups`] | `/api/lookups/summary` — the mining funnel |
//! | [`kanji`] | `/api/kanji` — every kanji read, and how well each is known |
//! | [`anki`] | `/api/anki/*` — deck snapshot, re-encounter stats, the card report |
//! | [`vocab`] | `/api/vocab/*` — the knowledge ledger: status counts, rebuild |
//! | [`mining_queue`] | `/api/queue` — candidates captured while reading, and what becomes of them |
//! | [`tokenize`] | `/api/tokenize` — the pipeline's output for pasted text |
//! | [`settings`] | `/api/settings`, `/api/pause` |
//! | [`reader`] | the `#read` view: line feed, mine, explain |
