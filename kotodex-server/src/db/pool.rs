//! Opening the two databases, and the migrations kotodex-server owns.
//!
//! kotodex-server holds two: its own (`settings`, `reader_marks`,
//! `work_covers`, `mining_queue`) and jp-core's shared `knowledge.db`
//! (`lines`, `works`, `manual_sessions`, `anki_notes`, `word_days`, `lookups`,
//! and the dictionary cache). Only the first is migrated here — the shared
//! schema has one owner, and it is [`jp_core::knowledge`].
//!
//! Migrations are plain `.sql` files replayed unconditionally on every start —
//! each is written to be idempotent (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`), so there is
//! no version table to keep in sync.
