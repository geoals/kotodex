// it stores is stamped onto every line the logger captures next. The empty
// string is a value it takes: nothing is being read, and lines captured until
// something is get stamped with no title at all.
//
// Everything a work *is* is edited in one form — length, cover, status, and the
// window the game draws in. As a second form with its own save button, the window
// lets a reader fill in three fields, close the dialog, and leave capture
// pointing at the last VN.
//
// **Adding a work is a title search, not a form.** `GET /api/works/search` asks
// VNDB by name and picks up the id and the cover, so neither is typed in. The
// character count is optional, and is asked for on the progress bar that wants it
// rather than in the way of getting started.
