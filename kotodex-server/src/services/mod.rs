//! Talking to things that aren't this program.
//!
//! Everything here crosses a process or network boundary, which is what
//! separates it from [`crate::stats`] (pure) and [`crate::db`] (local storage).
//! They share one rule: a side channel failing must never take the request with
//! it. A cover that won't download, a whisper-service that isn't up, an
//! enrichment call that times out — each degrades to a missing field, not a 500.
//!
//! | module | talks to |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`anki`] | AnkiConnect, read-only — snapshots the mined deck |
//! | [`audio`] | the Local Audio Server for Yomitan, for a word's pronunciation |
//! | [`card`] | AnkiConnect — adds a card, then enriches it; every card path's seam |
//! | [`capture`] | `capture/vn-capture.sh` |
//! | [`desktop`] | the window manager — what is open, and what is in front |
//! | [`notify`] | the desktop's notification daemon — the one report a finished mine makes |
//! | [`reading`] | [`desktop`] — which work the open windows say is being read |
//! | [`llm`] | whichever model the install names, through [`jp_mine_core::llm`] |
//! | [`jp_mine_core::compactdef`] | — (builds the prompt [`llm`] sends, then the field value) |
//! | [`jp_mine_core::tags`] | — (the two-axis tag rubric both prompts share) |
//! | [`covers`] | fetches and stores work cover images |
//! | [`vndb`] | vndb.org, for the cover a work's art comes from |
