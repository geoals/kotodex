// The overlay strip's whole client: draw the newest line, and define the word
// that is clicked in it.
// Only the newest line is ever drawn. The few before it are asked for through
// the stream's `backlog` so the explain button has context from the moment the
// overlay opens; on a dropped connection EventSource reconnects with
// `Last-Event-ID`, so it resumes after the line it drew.
// Segmentation is not asked for separately: the line event already carries a
// span per word, each with the `(headword, reading)` the ledger keys on. The
// popup asks about that pair, so 振っ is defined as 振る. Where the tokenizer
// got the position wrong — 経年劣化 split into 経年 and 劣化, 素振り read as
// すぶり where the line means そぶり — the popup carries a chip per other match
// the dictionaries offer, and picking one re-opens it on that term; see
// expansions().
// ♪ in the popup head plays the word, from the Local Audio Server add-on
// running beside Anki. kotodex-server proxies it: that server binds loopback
// and sends no CORS headers, so neither this page nor a phone reading the
// overlay can ask it directly.
// Three actions on a word, and only one of them opens the popup: left-click
// asks what it means, the back side button judges it known or unknown, the
// forward one mines it. Splitting them that way is what keeps the lookup count
// honest — see `SIDE_ACTIONS`. The wheel over that word pages the popup's
// dictionaries, which is not a fourth action: the popup is already open, so
// nothing is looked up and nothing is written.
