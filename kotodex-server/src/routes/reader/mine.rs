//! Making a card from the overlay, the way Yomitan makes one.
//!
//! The note is built here and then handed to
//! [`crate::services::card::add_note`], which every card path calls — Yomitan's
//! own add arrives there too, through the proxy. That is deliberate and
//! load-bearing: note-id extraction, the CompactDef enrichment, vn-capture's
//! screenshot and voiceline, the deck mirror and the notification all hang off that
//! one function, so an overlay card and a Yomitan card are the same thing
//! downstream rather than a second implementation kept in step by hand.
//!
//! The note type and its field names come from [`jp_mine_core::config::AnkiConfig`],
//! the same map the exporter uses, so this card fits whichever of the two
//! supported note types is configured.
//!
//! The pitch fields are rebuilt here rather than left empty, because the card
//! template needs them: `markPitch()` colours the target word by the first
//! digit it finds in the pitch-position field, so an empty one silently costs
//! the colour. The markup is Yomitan's own, reproduced span for span.
//!
//! The word audio is a native recording from the local-audio add-on, which is
//! also where Yomitan's audio sources point, so both surfaces attach the same
//! file. The sentence audio and picture come from vn-capture, exactly as they
//! do for a Yomitan card.
