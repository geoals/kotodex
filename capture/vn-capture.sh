# VN mine capture — bind this to a single hotkey.
# Cuts the last voiceline out of the kotodex-capture ring buffer (start = timestamp
# of the last Japanese line Textractor hooked, end = silero-VAD end of speech,
# never past the *next* hooked line), screenshots the active window, and
# attaches both to the most recently added note of the configured note type.
# Requires: kotodex-capture running, curl, jq, ffmpeg, and one screenshot tool
# (grim, spectacle, gnome-screenshot or ImageMagick's import)
# Env: VN_DRY=1        build the clip + screenshot but skip Anki, keep files
#                      (also skips the sentence trim — it needs the note)
#      VN_JSON=1       print a JSON result object instead of notifying the
#                      desktop — for kotodex-server's reader view, which shows the
#                      result in the browser that mined
#      VN_MAX_LEN=10   max seconds of audio considered after the line appears
#      VN_ANCHOR_TS    epoch seconds; anchor on the newest hooked line at *that*
#                      instant rather than at the moment this script runs. What
#                      kotodex-server passes when a card add triggers the capture,
#                      so reading on while the capture works can't move the
#                      anchor onto the next line.
#      VN_POOL=1       capture only what the ring will forget — the screenshot
#                      and the raw PCM window — into VN_OUTDIR, print JSON and
#                      stop. No VAD, no whisper, no Anki. For kotodex-server's
#                      mining queue, which fires this per candidate line while
#                      reading and cannot afford a silero load each time. The
#                      trims are not skipped but deferred: they read clip.raw,
#                      not the ring, so promotion can still run them — and the
#                      sentence trim works better there, where the mined word
#                      is finally known.
#      VN_CLIP         resume from a clip saved earlier by VN_POOL instead of
#      VN_IMAGE        cutting a new one out of the ring. The pair is how a
#                      queued candidate becomes a card: the ring is long gone,
#                      but every trim from here on reads the clip, so they all
#                      still run — the sentence trim for the first time, now
#                      that VN_NOTE_ID says which word was mined.
#      VN_LINE_TEXT    the line the saved clip belongs to, for the messages —
#                      with VN_CLIP the hooker's log no longer holds it.
#      VN_OUTDIR       where VN_POOL writes. Required with it, and durable:
#                      the default run directory is tmpfs and does not survive
#                      a reboot.
#      VN_NOTE_ID      attach to this note instead of the most recently added
#                      one — again for the card-add path, which already knows
#                      which note it just created.
#      VN_MIN_PEAK_DB  reject a clip whose peak is quieter than this (default
#                      -25 dBFS — a silence floor, not a voice test)
#      VN_WHISPER_URL  whisper-service for sentence trim (default :8100)
#      VN_WINDOW       name (substring) of the VN's window — capture it by id
#                      instead of whatever has focus. Needed when mining from
#                      kotodex-server's #read page, where the browser is focused.
#                      Unset, it is asked for: kotodex-server holds it per work.
#      KOTODEX_SERVER_URL  where to ask (default http://localhost:3200)
