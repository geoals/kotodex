//! SQLite access, one module per table family.
//!
//! Everything here is thin: bind parameters, run a statement, map rows to a
//! struct. No derivation, no policy — that lives in [`crate::stats`] (pure
//! functions over the rows these return) and in [`crate::history`] (which
//! decides *which* rows a request needs). Keeping it thin is what lets the
//! derivations be unit-tested without a database.
//!
//! There are **two databases**, and which one a module talks to is visible in
//! its signature: knowledge modules take a [`jp_core::knowledge::Knowledge`],
//! local ones take a bare `SqlitePool`. Both are SQLite pools and both create
//! their file on demand, so passing the wrong one would fail silently against a
//! freshly created empty table — the newtype makes that a compile error.
//!
//! | module | tables | database |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`pool`] | — | opens both |
//! | [`settings`] | `settings` | kotodex.db |
//! | [`marks`] | `reader_marks` | kotodex.db |
//! | [`mining_queue`] | `mining_queue` | kotodex.db |
//! | [`covers`] | `work_covers` | kotodex.db |
//! | [`lines`] | `lines` | knowledge.db |
//! | [`works`] | `works` | knowledge.db |
//! | [`books`] | `books` | knowledge.db |
//! | [`sessions`] | `manual_sessions` | knowledge.db |
//! | [`anki_notes`] | `anki_notes` | knowledge.db |
//! | [`word_days`] | `word_days` | knowledge.db |
//! | [`lookups`] | `lookups` | knowledge.db |
//!
//! `vocabulary` is the exception with no module here: its queries live in
//! `jp_core::knowledge::vocabulary` because kotodex-server is not its only caller —
//! the highlighter, the triage UI and yt-mine all read the same ledger, which
//! is the second-consumer test the rest of these tables have not met yet.
//!
//! The split: what is *about the reading* is shared, because other tools ask
//! questions of it; what is about this app's own behaviour stays local. Only two places straddle the line —
//! [`works::current_work_vn_window`] and [`covers::fetch_work_covers`] — and
//! both do the join in memory rather than attaching one database to the other.
