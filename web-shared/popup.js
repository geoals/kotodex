// them. It renders `jp_core::define`'s answer, which both hosts serve.
//
// What is *not* here is anything about the surface it sits on. The overlay
// draws over a game in a layer-shell strip, mines a card the moment ＋ is hit,
// and has side mouse buttons that judge without opening anything; yt-mine is
// an ordinary scrolling page with none of that. So the host supplies the
// placement, the two writes (`judge`, `mine`), and the text the expansion scan
// reads — and gets back an object it opens, closes and pages.
//
// Vanilla DOM on purpose. One host is a plain page and the other is Preact,
// and the way to share between those is to belong to neither.
