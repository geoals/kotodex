// The shelf: what is being read, what is planned, and what the reading turned
// into.
//
// Cards rather than table rows, because a work is a cover and a handful of
// numbers and a row can only carry the numbers. Clicking one opens its own
// page (`work-detail.js`) — everything per-work lives there, which is what
// keeps this level to "what is on the shelf and how far in am I".
//
// A work with no reading behind it is a cover in the planned row, not a card:
// every number on a card is zero until it has been read, and the queue is
// about which cover comes next. Every cover is the same size everywhere — the
// shelves are one row of books, not a tier list.
//
// The kind filter is over what a work is (`/api/works` derives it): all, or
// one of the two things a shelf holds — VNs, and everything read off paper.
